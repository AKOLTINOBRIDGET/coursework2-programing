This report provides an overview of a Python program designed to facilitate user interaction by prompting their user name, age, and favorite number, implementing features such as error handling for non-numeric inputs and conditional logic to assess the favorite number and basing on that a list of books is printed as a suggestion to the user.
 Additionally, it includes a class Book  with attributes like title, author, and publication year, which are initialized using a constructer whose attributes are used in creating objects
Explanation of class creation
 class classname:
def constructer method(self,parameteres for class):
       self.title=parameter

  def method_name(self,varable if needed):
      print(output desired )

Error Handling:
The function checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list, avoiding any
potential errors that could occur from attempting to sort an empty list.
Sorting Mechanism: The function uses “sorted()” with a lambda function as its key. The

Iteration Techniques
The program demonstrates iteration with both for loops and while loops:

Advanced Looping
Searching for a Book is a fuction used to implement the advanced looping where true is the positive or show a contition of progressive repetition unless a certain condition is met that breaks out of the loop.
This program allows the user to search for a book by its title and while loop prompts the user for input continually until the user choses to exit  to stop the search.

Inside this loop, another for loop searches through the sorted list of books to check if the
:
When the program prompts the user for their age and favorite number, it wraps this
functionality in a try-except block to handle potential Value Error. This occurs specifically when the user inputs non-numeric values. If an error is caught, the program prints a message informing the user to enter a valid number, which enhances the user experience by preventing the program from crashing and guides them on the exact input.

Lastly  the Python program successfully combines user engagement, error handling as to create an interactive
Application and the two  questions are combined into one program. The use of functions and classes enhances code organization and promotes re-usage and reduces on repetition
